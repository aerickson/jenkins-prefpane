h1. jenkins-prefpane

Jenkins-prefpane is a simple shortcut to start/stop the Jenkins CI process.

h2. Installation

* Clone the source and compile the source, then run the .prefpane generated.
* Download the compressed binary version from the downloads page

h2. Updating

It currently doesn't track updates with Sparkle, so you will need to come back later and download new versions.

h2. Configuration

As of this version it will try to get the mongod binary from popular places (/usr/local/bin/mongod, /usr/bin/mongod, /bin/mongod/, /opt/bin/mongod). If for any weird reason you have it in a differnt location, you will need to set it in DaemonController.h.
i.e. @#define MONGOD_LOCATION @"/fruity/loops/mongod"@

If you need to set extra parameters to run jenkins, then edit the Arguments textbox from the pane.

h2. Known Issues

It crashes System Preferences when re/installing the .prefpane.

h2. Credits

jenkins-prefpane was forked from https://github.com/ivanvc/mongodb.prefpane.

DaemonController and MBSliderButton based in the ones made by Max Howell
